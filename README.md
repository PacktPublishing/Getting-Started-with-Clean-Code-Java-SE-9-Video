This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Clean Code Java SE 9 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/getting-started-clean-code-java-se-9-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787285064), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Getting started with clean code Java SE 9, this practical video series aims to demonstrate the power of the completely new and revolutionary Java Platform ever released, to build high quality, modular, maintainable, and really secure software.
This video series will make you a master the Java SE 9’s core concepts, components, tools, and the new big features, so you can become a Java SE 9 Ninja. By the end of the first section of volume one, you will master the Java Modularity goals and concepts, to understand why we need such a completely new Java Platform, followed by the second section where we will go through the installation steps of the JDK 9 and Intellij IDE to help us prepare our development environment for the entire course.
The second volume, section one we will deep dive into the Java Platform Module Systems in more details, and the core JDK structure changes. While the second section will introduce more advanced topics about modularity and covers all the techniques that will help you migrate your codebase smoothly to Java 9. The final section will introduce the great new features shipped with the language to make you aware of how to create a custom runtime images aka customized JREs, so your application work efficiently on scaled-down systems, finally how to create a pluggable, and loosely coupled modules with the concept of services, service provider, and service consumers.
All the topics are powered by examples to make the explanations practical too.
